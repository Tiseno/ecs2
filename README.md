# Entity Component System v2 (ECS)
An implementation of an ECS inspired by [David Colsons'](https://github.com/davidcolson) excellent [blog post](https://www.david-colson.com/2020/02/09/making-a-simple-ecs.html) from 2020.

Version 2 uses sparse sets for a more effective iteration and storage.

Credit to Oleksandr Manenko's which provided a great [detailed explanation of sparse sets](https://manenko.com/2021/05/23/sparse-sets.html) in 2021.
